Super Asteroid Blaster was a straightforward side scrolling shooter I put together. It was fun putting the parallax background together and getting different visuals to work. The little explosion was my favorite part. I'm proud of how well the visuals turned out for a short term project like this.

Little Diablo Labyrinth is a puzzle game I put together starting the titular character, Little Diablo. Collect keys and dodge enemies to open up new areas.

I added a new enemy here in the spinning blue blades, creating urgency for the player and testing their pattern memorization.


Little Diablo is a bit childish to me in hindsight but I thought he was charming. He looks pretty ugly close up though! My art skills have improved a bit since I drew this little guy.
