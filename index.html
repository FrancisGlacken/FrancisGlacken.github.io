			  <p>My name is Francis Glacken and I am an aspiring Android developer, game creator and lover of art in its many forms. I want to create content that helps and/or inspires people, whether that be a well designed user interface, a Java class or a thought provoking story. Currently, I'm working towards an associate's degree in game design at Delaware County Community College. I also spend time working on a couple different HTML based games and towards publishing a time-keeping app on the Google Play Store. I hope to improve myself in any way I can.</p> 

			  <p>I learned a lot about tech over the past few years, using resources from college courses, youtube tutorials, programming challenges, online forums, documentation, textbooks and even going to seminars and developer meetups. I'll take whatever I can get my hands on if I think it will help me be a better programmer and to further my career. I started taking programming courses at DCCC a few years back in my pursuit of game design. This led me to learn a variety of languages and programs due to the complex nature of video games, but I wasn't focused in my learning. About 18 months ago I started to commit serious amounts of time to Android programming with my best friend as my partner, and that is really where I started getting confident in programming and my general abilities. This portfolio helped me look back on how far I've come and reminded me of how I got here. </p>
